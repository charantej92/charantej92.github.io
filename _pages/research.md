#### AI-driven Enhancements in Camera Pipeline
Ongoing research focuses on learning-based improvements across the ISP pipeline, including denoising, demosaicing, HDR, color correction, and tone mapping. Emphasis is placed on compact, efficient models optimized for real-time deployment on mobile and edge devices. The goal is to develop adaptive, sensor-aware ISP solutions that enhance image quality across diverse conditions.

#### Child Eye
This research aims to leverage infants' spatial learning and visual experiences to enhance computer vision algorithms, addressing the shortcomings of current systems compared to human children. We investigate whether training models from a child's perspective can improve AI's effectiveness in interpreting real-world scenes.

#### 3D stomata segmentation 
Stomata are microscopic pores on plant surfaces that regulate photosynthesis in crops essential for food and sustainable materials. This research seeks to automate the 3D segmentation of stomatal guard cells from confocal microscopy data, overcoming challenges such as hardware limitations, difficult localization, and low optical resolution to enable accurate measurement of their morphology for studying physiology and biomechanics.

### Fourier Analysis

 The significance and prevalence of the FFT algorithm cannot be emphasized enough. As datasets continue to grow in size, there is a demand to lower the complexity below the traditional FFT's $O(N \log N)$ bound. A crucial aspect is to recognize and leverage scenarios that impact the DFT coefficients. With this in consideration, I pose the following inquiry:

"Which structures on the frequency support, of size $k$, allow for a computational complexity of $O(k\log k)$?" ([details](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308632))

### Adversarial Machine Learning
{: style="font-size:1.2em; color: #7a8288;"}

The phenomenon of carefully crafted imperceptible perturbations causing misclassification in state-of-the-art deep learning models is widely acknowledged. Analyzing and comprehending these adversarial perturbations is vital for developing robust convolutional neural networks. However, their underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. I explored the following question:

"Is there any relationship between the imperceptibility and semantic significance of adversarial perturbations?" In other words, "can adversarial perturbations change only the regions of the image that are important for classification, while still being imperceptible?" ([details](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10073613))
