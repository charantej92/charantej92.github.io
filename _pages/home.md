I am a Post doctoral scholor at Penn State working with [James Wang](https://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/home.shtml), [Brad Wyble](https://wyblelab.com/), and [Charles Anderson](https://science.psu.edu/bio/people/cta3). I got my joint Ph.D. at IIT Hyderabad and SUT Australia, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Aditya Siripuram](https://people.iith.ac.in/staditya/), and [Jingxin Zhang](https://experts.swinburne.edu.au/1746-jingxin-zhang).

Before that, I was with MathWorks for a brief period of time. I completed my Master's from IIT Hyderabad.

I can be reached via email (charantejreddy.p [at] gmail.com).

### Research Summary
In Signal Processing, my research primarily focuses on identifying support structures for which the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can be computed fast and designing corresponding algorithms. My most [recent work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308632) explores the connection between additive structure of the frequency support and computational complexity of the DFT.

In Machine Learning, my research mainly centers around Adversarial Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on examining these issues from a perceptual standpoint. My [recent work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10073613) investigates the relationship between the imperceptibility and semantic significance of adversarial perturbations.




 Here is my [CV](/files/CV_Charan.pdf). -->
