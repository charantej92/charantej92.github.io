I am a joint Ph.D. Student at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) and [SUT Australia](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/). Previously, I was with [MathWorks India](https://in.mathworks.com/) for a brief period of time. I completed my Master's degree from [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/).

I can be reached via email (ee18resch01010 [at] iith.ac.in).

### Research Interests
Signal Processing and Machine Learning


### Research Summary
In Signal Processing, my research primarily focuses on identifying support structures for which the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can be computed fast and designing corresponding algorithms. My most [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15299) explores the connection between additive structure of the frequency support and computational complexity of the DFT.

In Machine Learning, my research mainly centers around Adversarial Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on examining these issues from a perceptual standpoint. My [recent work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10073613) investigates the relationship between the imperceptibility and semantic significance of adversarial perturbations.
